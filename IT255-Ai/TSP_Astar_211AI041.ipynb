    "The code uses the following data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph**: The `Graph` class represents the graph of cities and their distances. It uses a 2D list (adjacency matrix) to store the distances between cities. The graph is initialized with the number of vertices (cities) and provides methods to add edges with their corresponding weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: The `minimum_spanning_tree` method of the `Graph` class calculates the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm. It utilizes arrays (`min_cost`, `parent`, and `visited`) to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each city, the parent city in the MST, and the visited status of each city.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Priority Queue**: The `queue` variable is a priority queue implemented using the `heapq` module. It is used to store the states during the A* search. The states are organized based on their costs, with the state having the lowest cost at the top of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **State**: The `State` class represents a state in the search space. It contains information about the current city, the visited cities, and the cost associated with reaching the current state. The `__lt__` method is defined to compare states based on their costs, allowing them to be ordered in the priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these data structures enables efficient exploration of the search space, with the graph representing the cities and distances, the minimum spanning tree heuristic guiding the search, the priority queue managing the states based on their costs, and the state object encapsulating the necessary information for each state in the search."
