    "# Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Flow: The brute-force method for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) uses a recursive approach to generate all possible permutations of cities. It explores each permutation, calculates the total distance for each tour, and updates the minimum distance whenever a complete tour is found. The code backtracks by removing visited cities to explore other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity Analysis: The brute-force method has an exponential time complexity of O(n!), where n is the number of cities. This is because it generates and evaluates all possible permutations, which grows factorially with the input size. As a result, the brute-force method becomes impractical for larger problem instances due to the exponential explosion of computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Important Considerations:\n",
    "  1. Efficiency: The brute-force method guarantees finding the optimal solution for the TSP by examining all possible tours. However, its computational complexity limits its practical use to small problem sizes.\n",
    "  2. Trade-off: While the brute-force method provides an exact solution, it may not be suitable for real-world TSP instances due to its computational demands. In such cases, approximation algorithms or heuristics are often employed to find high-quality solutions within a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "  3. Problem Scaling: The brute-force method becomes infeasible as the number of cities increases. For example, even for just 20 cities, there are approximately 2.43 Ã— 10^18 possible tours, making exhaustive enumeration impractical.\n",
    "  4. Optimization: Various techniques can be applied to improve the efficiency of the brute-force method, such as memoization to store and reuse intermediate results, pruning techniques to eliminate redundant computations, or parallelization to utilize multiple processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the brute-force method guarantees optimal solutions for the TSP, its exponential time complexity limits its practical use to small problem instances. Efficient approximation algorithms or heuristics are preferred for larger-scale TSPs, striking a balance between solution quality and computational resources."

    "  1. Population Size: Choosing an appropriate population size is crucial. A larger population allows for more exploration of the search space but increases computation time.\n",

    "- Solution Quality: The genetic algorithm is a heuristic approach that provides approximate solutions to the TSP. The quality of the solution depends on various factors, including the parameters, the characteristics of the problem instance (e.g., number of cities, geometry), and the randomness in the algorithm. It may find good solutions but does not guarantee finding the optimal solution.\n",

    "- Scalability: The genetic algorithm is suitable for larger TSP instances compared to brute-force methods. However, as the number of cities increases, the time required for fitness evaluation and the search space grow, making it challenging to find high-quality solutions within a reasonable time for very large-scale problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the genetic algorithm is a flexible and widely used approach for tackling the TSP. It strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation, providing approximate solutions to TSP instances with reasonable computational resources. Effective parameter tuning and implementation considerations can significantly impact the performance and quality of the solutions obtained."
