    "# Introduction\n",
    "Minesweeper and the Wumpus World have some similarities in terms of grid-based gameplay and exploration. In both games, the player interacts with a rectangular grid of squares and needs to make informed decisions to achieve a specific goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Minesweeper, the objective is to probe every unmined square without triggering any mines. The game provides clues in the form of numbers that indicate the number of mines adjacent to a particular square. These clues help the player deduce the locations of the mines and safely probe the remaining squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wumpus World, on the other hand, is a more complex game where the player explores a grid-based cave system inhabited by a mythical creature called the Wumpus. The goal is to find a safe path to the gold without encountering the Wumpus or falling into pits. The player receives sensory feedback about adjacent squares, such as breezes near pits or a stench near the Wumpus, which aids in making strategic moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the two games have distinct themes and rules, they both involve navigating a grid, avoiding dangerous elements, and using available information to make informed decisions."

    "To generalize the assertion from part (a) and to construct a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) sentence asserting that k of n neighbors contain mines, we can use a similar approach. Here's how to construct the CNF sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let X(i, j) represent the proposition that square [i, j] contains a mine.\n",
    "2. Define N(i, j) as the set of neighbors of square [i, j]. For example, N(1, 1) would be {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}.\n",
    "3. Determine the combinations of k neighbors out of n total neighbors. This can be done using combinatorial techniques such as combinations or permutations.\n",
    "4. For each combination of k neighbors, create a clause that asserts the presence of mines in those squares. The clause can be formed by taking the logical conjunction (AND) of the propositions representing the mines in those squares.\n",
    "5. Combine all the clauses using logical disjunction (OR) to create the CNF sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example to illustrate the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to assert that exactly 3 out of the 8 neighbors of square [1, 1] contain mines.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. X(i, j) represents the proposition that square [i, j] contains a mine.\n",
    "2. N(1, 1) = {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)} represents the neighbors of square [1, 1].\n",
    "3. The combinations of 3 neighbors out of 8 can be determined using combinatorial techniques. Let's assume the combinations are: {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}, {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3)}, {(1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)}, and so on.\n",
    "4. For each combination, create a clause representing the presence of mines. For example, the first combination {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)} corresponds to the clause X(1, 2) ∧ X(2, 1) ∧ X(2, 2).\n",
    "5. Combine all the clauses using logical disjunction. So, the CNF sentence would be (X(1, 2) ∧ X(2, 1) ∧ X(2, 2)) ∨ (Clause 2) ∨ (Clause 3) ∨ ...\n",
    "\n",
    "By constructing this CNF sentence, we assert that exactly 3 out of the 8 neighbors of square [1, 1] contain mines. The process can be generalized for different values of k and n, allowing us to assert different combinations of mines among the neighbors."

    "One example of a configuration of probe values that induces long-range dependencies is when there are alternating mines and safe squares along the entire row. Here's an illustration with N = 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "M _ M _ M _ M _ M _ M\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this configuration, the alternating pattern of mines (M) and safe squares (_) creates a dependency between distant squares. Specifically, knowing the contents of a square at one end of the row provides information about the contents of a far-distant square at the other end of the row.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we probe the square at position 1 (left end of the row) and find it to be a mine, we can conclude that the square at position 10 (right end of the row) must be safe. Similarly, if we probe the square at position 10 and find it to be a mine, we can infer that the square at position 1 must be safe. This long-range dependency arises due to the consistent alternating pattern along the row.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, the contents of a given unprobed square can provide valuable information about the contents of a far-distant square, allowing the player to make informed decisions in Minesweeper."
