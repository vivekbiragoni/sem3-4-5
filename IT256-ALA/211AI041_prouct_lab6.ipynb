    "This implementation defines two functions, `inner_product()` and `outer_product()`, that calculate the inner and outer product, respectively, between a vector and a matrix. The code includes checks to ensure that the length of the vector matches the number of columns in the matrix to properly perform the calculations. Additionally, the implementation includes test cases for both successful and failure cases. The inner product function calculates the dot product between a vector and each row of the matrix and returns the resulting vector. The outer product function calculates the outer product between a vector and a matrix and returns the resulting matrix. Overall, this implementation provides a straightforward and efficient way to compute the inner and outer product of a vector and matrix."
