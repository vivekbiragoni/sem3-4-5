INTRODUCTION & MOTIVATION

QuantumVizier: Exploring the Fascinating World of Quantum Computing


- Introduction: Quantum computing is an emerging field with the potential to revolutionize computation by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. 
- Motivation: The development of quantum computing brings forth new challenges and opportunities. Understanding and visualizing quantum states, such as those represented on the Bloch sphere, is crucial for comprehending the behavior of qubits and the effects of quantum gates. This motivates the creation of tools like the Bloch sphere visualizer to enhance learners' understanding and facilitate exploration of quantum states.


Note: QuantumVizier is intended for educational purposes and focuses on single qubit rotations. It does not support multi-qubit operations or advanced quantum algorithms.
